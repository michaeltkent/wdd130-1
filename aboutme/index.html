    <p>I am a freshman going into my first semester of Computer Science.</p>
    <p>I served 4 years in the Air Force and got stationed at Lackland AFB, San Antonio, Texas. Presidio of Monterey in Monterey, California. My last base was Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Tacoma, Washington.</p>
    <p>I am also a recent convert in The Church of Latter Day Saints and got baptized in June of 2023</p>
    <p>I would like to go into a career field within Computer Science because my dream job would to be working remotely!</p>
